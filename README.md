# Free Code Camp Front-End Projects
===================================

### This is my collection of the Front End project given by [FreeCodeCamp](http://www.freecodecamp.com). Below are the list (will be updating as soon as I complete each project). Technologies used throughout the projects include Javascript, JQuery, CSS, HTML, and Bootstrap.

***

## Basic Front End Projects:
1. A Tribute Page - This was the first project; using a basic HTML/CSS (Bootstrap), I made a tribute page for Mother Teresa that has her picture, timeline of her life, and a quote by her peers.
..* Technologies used: HTML/CSS
2. Personal Portfolio Webpage - This is a page that will become my personal webpage as I progress through the Front End course. I built a personal website that contains my information, portfolio list (which will hopefully be replaced by real projects; it is fillers right now), and a contact form (that will function as I learn the Backend). It is definitely a project I will keep working on as I learn more.
..* Technologies used: HTML/CSS/Javascript, Bootstrap

## Intermediate Front End Projects:
3. Build a Random Quote Machine - I built a Random Quote Machine that will generate a random Chuck Norris jokes with an option to tweet about it.
--* Technologies used: HTML/CSS/Javascript, Bootstrap
--* APIs include Chuck Norris Joke API and the Twitter API.
4. Show The Local Weather - This page shows the weather information of the local user's location. Available information include user's location (City, Country), its geolocation in lat/long format, and the temperature with options to toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit, and the weather icon and background that correlates with the weather condition (i.e. cloudy skies, rainy weather, etc.)
--* Technologies used: HTML/CSS/Javascript, Bootstrap
--* APIs include [Geolocation API](http://ip-api.com/), [OpenWeather API](http://openweathermap.org/)
